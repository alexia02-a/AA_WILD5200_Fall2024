## Worksheet 2 & 3: Measures of disease frequency

![](images/ss_table.png)

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

59 is the necessary sample size to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

The sample size requirements for detecting disease at 1% prevalence with 95% confidence is 299 and at 2% prevalence at 99% confidence, the sample size is 229.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you\
are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_\_\_ (\<, =,\
\>) \_\_\_\_%.

=0%

4\) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of\
Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and\
Russell counties).\
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.

The prevalence of lame turkeys in Chambers County was 26.7% (95% CI; 13.1% to 44.9%).

The prevalence of lameness in turkeys in Lee Couny is 20.0% (95% CI; 14.3% to 27.3%).

The prevalence of lameness in turkeys in Russell County is 3.1% (95% CI; 0.9% to 8.7%).

\
b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.

Utilizing QPweb software, there is a p-value of \<0.0001 meaning that the differences between the prevalence of lame turkeys in 3 different counties is statically significant.

5\) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
Day 1: 3 fish infected\
Day 2: 4 fish infected\
Day 3: 7 fish infected\
Day 4: 11 fish infected\
Day 5: 20 fish infected\
Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
in the pond (including previously infected fish).\

a\) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.

Day 1 Incidence: 0.05 cases per fish per day

Day 2 Incidence: 0.070 cases per fish per day

Day 5 Incidence: 0.571 cases per fish per day

\
b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?

Day 3 Prevalence: 23.3%

Day 5 Prevalence: 75%

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

On day 1, the prevalence is the same as the incidence regardless of units. That number being 0.05.\
